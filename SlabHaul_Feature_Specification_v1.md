# SlabHaul Feature Specification v1

## MVP Core Features

1. **Public Attractor Map** (Low Complexity): Aggregate and clean GPX files from state DNRs (TN, AR, MS, AL, TX) to show thousands of public brush piles, PVC trees, and pallets. This is the "bread and butter" for crappie.

2. **Weather for Anglers** (Low Complexity): 7-day forecast including barometric pressure trends, wind speed/direction, and sunrise/set. Essential for planning.

3. **Lake Level & Temp Tracker** (Medium Complexity): Integrate USGS/USACE data for water levels. Critical Addition: Surface Temperature. Deep Dive users explicitly complain about the lack of temp data. SlabHaul must include this to beat the benchmark.

4. **Spider Rigging Depth Calculator** (Medium Complexity): A physics-based tool. User inputs line length, sinker weight, and boat speed; App outputs estimated jig depth.

5. **Basic Wind Map** (Medium Complexity): Show wind speed and direction overlays to help anglers plan safe trolling routes.

## Crappie Knowledge Base (From Mastering the Art of Crappie Fishing)

### 1. Seasonal Patterns Table

| Season / Phase | Water Temp Triggers | Depth Ranges | Prime Locations | Top Techniques | Best Baits & Colors | Environmental Factors |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Winter** | < 50°F | Deep (15–30'+) | Deep holes, river channels, submerged brush. Suspended in open water. | Vertical Jigging, Slow Trolling, FFS "Sniper" fishing. | **Baits:** Compact profiles (Akara Midge), heavy tungsten jigs.<br>**Colors:** Bone White/Chartreuse (matches dying shad). | Shad kills occur; dying shad flutter down, making white/chartreuse deadly. Fish may roam high in the column on warm afternoons. |
| **Pre-Spawn** | 50°F–60°F | Transition (8–15') | Creek arms, staging near secondary points, following bait into bays. | Long Line Trolling, Spider Rigging. | **Baits:** 2–3 inch shad profiles (following bait schools).<br>**Colors:** Natural shad patterns. | Crappie aggressively feed to bulk up. Males move shallower first. |
| **Spawn** | 61°F–68°F (Peak) | Shallow (1.5–6') | Emergent vegetation, near shore brush, stumps, nests in colonies. | Single Poling (Dipping), Float & Fly, Casting. | **Baits:** Tubes, hair jigs, minnows.<br>**Colors:** Bright colors (Pink, Chartreuse) for aggression strikes. | Males aggressively defend nests; will strike anything near the bed. Clear water requires stealth/longer casts. |
| **Post-Spawn / Summer** | > 70°F | Deep / Variable | Deep submerged timber, thermocline breaks, bridge pilings, docks. | Dock Shooting, Power Trolling, Crankbait Trolling. | **Baits:** Small fry profiles (1–1.5"), Spinnerbaits.<br>**Colors:** Match fry (translucent/natural). | Fish seek oxygenated water near thermoclines. High sun pushes fish deep or under solid shade (docks). |
| **Fall** | Cooling Trends | Mid-Depth (10–20') | Creek mouths, following shad back into tributaries. | Casting FFS, Long Lining. | **Baits:** 2–3 inch shad profiles.<br>**Colors:** Match water clarity (Blue/Purple for clear, Chartreuse for stained). | "Feed up" period before winter. Turnover may scatter fish temporarily. |

### 2. Techniques Database Table

| Technique | Description | Setup Tips (Rods, Spreads, Speeds) | Best Conditions | Pros (+) / Cons (−) | Pro Tips |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Spider Rigging (Slow Trolling)** | Pushing multiple baits from the bow using long poles. | **Rods:** 10–16' poles (e.g., B'n'M Capps & Coleman).<br>**Speed:** Slow, controlled into wind.<br>**Rig:** Double hook minnow rigs with heavy weights. | Any season; dominant tournament tactic. | (+) Covers water precisely.<br>(+) Presents multiple depths.<br>(−) Equipment intensive. | Use chains to slow boat in high wind. Pushing is generally more precise than pulling. |
| **Dock Shooting** | Slingshotting lures into tight spaces under docks using rod tension. | **Rods:** 7' medium/stout with flexible tip (e.g., 7'4").<br>**Line:** Hi-vis line to watch for "slack" bites. | Sunny days (fish seeking shade). | (+) Accesses unpressured fish.<br>(+) High catch rate on sunny days.<br>(−) High learning curve; requires practice. | Release the jig low to the water (skipping stones motion). Count down the jig to specific depths before retrieving. |
| **LiveScope "Sniping" (FFS)** | Targeting specific roaming or structure-oriented fish using Forward Facing Sonar. | **Rods:** 14–20' rods for vertical dipping from a distance.<br>**Tech:** Garmin LiveScope, Lowrance Active Target. | Suspended fish in open water or deep brush. | (+) Highest efficiency; see fish reaction.<br>(+) Target specific trophy fish.<br>(−) Expensive; "Video game" fishing feel. | Never drop bait below the fish; always keep it above their eyes. Keep boat distance to avoid spooking. |
| **Long Line Trolling (Pulling)** | Dragging jigs or crankbaits behind the boat. | **Rods:** Staggered lengths to spread lines.<br>**Speed:** Faster than spider rigging (0.8–1.2 mph). | Pre/Post-spawn; scattered/suspended fish. | (+) Covers massive water area.<br>(−) Less precise depth control on turns. | Use single jigs to reduce tangles on turns. Try crankbaits (Bandit 300s) for big fish. |
| **Single Pole Jigging** | Vertical dipping into heavy cover (standing timber, stumps). | **Rods:** 10–12' sensitive jig poles (e.g., Tree Thumper).<br>**Rig:** Jig tipped with Crappie Nibble. | Heavy cover (timber/brush) where trolling snags. | (+) Precise placement in thick cover.<br>(−) Covers water slowly. | Hold the jig still; avoid aggressive jerking. Watch the line for "heaviness" or slack. |

| Bait Type | Top Sizes & Models | Best Colors (Clarity/Season) | Rigging Methods | Ranking / Effectiveness Consensus |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| **Tube Jigs** | 1.5"–2.5" (Southern Pro Lit'l Hustler) | **Clear:** Monkey Milk, Blue Ice.<br>**Stained:** Electric Chicken, Acid Rain. | Insert jighead into hollow body or thread like a grub. | **#1 All-Time Versatility.** Can be cast, jigged, or shot. The "must-have" lure. |
| **Soft Plastic Minnows/Shad** | 2"–3" (Bobby Garland Baby Shad, Slab Slay'R) | **Winter:** Bone White/Chartreuse.<br>**Summer:** Natural fry patterns. | Jighead (1/32–1/8 oz). Tail action is key (spear tail vs. paddle). | **#1 for Dock Shooting.** Streamlined shapes skip best. High efficacy for FFS usage. |
| **Curly Tail Grubs** | 2"–2.5" (Z-Man GrubZ) | **Clear:** Motor Oil.<br>**Muddy:** Black/Fluorescent. | Standard jighead. The tail vibration is essential for strolling/casting. | **High. Timeless.** Highest "fish-per-bait" rating due to durability of ElaZtech materials. |
| **Hair Jigs** | 1/16–1/8 oz | *(Data incomplete in source)* | *(Data incomplete in source)* | *(Data incomplete in source)* |

### SWOT Analysis for Deep Dive

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|------------|
| **Elite Brand Trust:** Endorsed by top pros (Jordan Lee, Chris Zaldain) and featured on Bassmaster/MLF streams. | **Cost Barrier:** $80/year is perceived as expensive by casual anglers; monthly billing confusion. |
| **Proprietary Tech:** Exclusive satellite clarity processing and hydrological modeling (Wind/Flow). | **Map Labeling:** Users complain about lack of local names for creeks/coves and navigational context. |
| **Regulatory Compliance:** "Tournament Mode" solves the "cheating" accusations and keeps the app legal. | **Data Gaps:** No surface temperature map (major complaint). Limited to ~600 lakes for advanced features. |
| **Data Visualization:** Replaces 5+ apps (weather, tides, generation, solunar) with one interface. | **Data Latency:** Satellite imagery can be days/weeks old due to cloud cover. |

| Opportunities | Threats |
|---------------|---------|
| **Species Expansion:** The tech stack is replicable for Crappie (SlabHaul), Walleye, or Saltwater. | **Platform Convergence:** Competitors (Omnia, Fishbrain, Navionics) are adding similar layers. |
| **Hardware Sync:** Direct integration with Garmin/Lowrance units for real-time map overlays. | **Regulatory Bans:** Tournament leagues could ban all real-time info apps, rendering "Tournament Mode" moot. |

### Unique Opportunities for SlabHaul

1. **The "Brush Pile Moat" (Data Aggregation)**
   - **Gap:** Deep Dive focuses on bass structure (points, grass, ledges). Crappie are structure-oriented, specifically towards brush.
   - **Opportunity:** Aggressively aggregate and visualize the thousands of public fish attractor coordinates provided by state agencies (AGFC, MDWFP, ADCNR, TPWD). Making this data "click-to-navigate" is a massive immediate value prop that Deep Dive ignores.

2. **The Thermocline Forecast**
   - **Gap:** Deep Dive focuses on "Best Areas" (XY coordinates).
   - **Opportunity:** Focus on the Z-coordinate (Depth). Crappie are lethal in the summer if you find the thermocline. Using temperature and clarity data to predict the specific depth of the thermocline (e.g., "Target 18ft deep over 30ft of water") solves the hardest problem in summer crappie fishing.

3. **Trolling/Spider Rigging Physics**
   - **Gap:** Deep Dive's "Bait Tool" suggests brands/colors.
   - **Opportunity:** Crappie anglers troll. They need to know: "If I use a 1/4oz weight at 0.8mph with 6lb line, how deep is my bait?" A Spider Rigging Depth Calculator is a utility tool that currently requires spreadsheets or trial-and-error.

4. **Surface Temperature Layer**
   - **Gap:** Deep Dive explicitly lacks a surface temperature map layer, forcing users to switch apps.
   - **Opportunity:** Integrating real-time surface temp (via USGS/buoy data) gives SlabHaul an immediate functional advantage over the benchmark.

### Monetization Insights

#### Deep Dive's Model

- **Freemium:** Free download with basic weather and limited map access.
- **Subscription:** $19.99/month or $79.99/year.
- **Conversion:** 7-day free trial is the primary funnel.
- **Value Prop:** "Time is money." The cost is justified by saving fuel and pre-fishing time.

#### Suggestions for SlabHaul

1. **Price Sensitivity Adjustment:** Crappie are often viewed as a "blue-collar" fish compared to the "industry" of bass fishing. A **$49.99/year** price point to undercut Deep Dive and align with Navionics.

2. **The "Meat Hunter" Pitch:** Unlike bass (catch and release), crappie are food. Market the subscription as "paying for itself in fillets." *"Fill your freezer faster."*

3. **Hardware File Monetization:** Offer the ability to download the curated "Brush Pile" databases directly to SD card formats (GPX, USR, HWR) as a **Pro-only feature**. This solves a major pain point of manually entering coordinates.

4. **Tournament Contingency:** Mimic Deep Dive's contingency program. Offer cash prizes for winning sanctioned crappie tournaments (e.g., Crappie Masters) while subscribed to SlabHaul. This builds legitimacy and "Pro" status.
